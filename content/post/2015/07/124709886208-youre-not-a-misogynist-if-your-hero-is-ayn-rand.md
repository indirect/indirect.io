Ayn Rand wouldn&rsquo;t care that you called her a slut on the internet. Ayn Rand doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s rape if you hold her down and shove your dick in her without permission. Ayn Rand probably drinks whiskey and plays beer pong and has always had way more guy friends because girls cause so much drama. She&rsquo;s the Sociopathic Pixie Dream Girl."
