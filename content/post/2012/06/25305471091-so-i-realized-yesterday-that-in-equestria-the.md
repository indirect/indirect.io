But then, it turns out that when they are thanked for the chariot ride they just gave, they neigh a response. So they are sentient, and enslaved, apparently because they lack the capacity for speech. And here I thought My Little Pony was going to be a lighthearted kid&rsquo;s show.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Retraction:</strong> It has since been pointed out to me that the male ponies not only volunteer their services (for which they are thanked), they also choose to throw themselves in harm&rsquo;s way when danger threatens (which I had missed before). That makes it pretty clear that while they still don&rsquo;t seem to be able speak, they aren&rsquo;t enslaved at all. Beyond that, in fact, the males are treated as free agents and equals, in spite of their verbal disability, which is more than I can say for most of humanity throughout history. I apologize for casting false aspersions on Twilight Sparkle and the female ponies of Equestria.</p>"
