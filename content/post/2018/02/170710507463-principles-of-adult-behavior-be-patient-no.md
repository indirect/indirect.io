Do not\nendanger it frivolously.  And never endanger the life of another.</li>\n<li>Never lie to anyone for any reason.</li>\n<li>Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.</li>\n<li>Avoid the pursuit of happiness.

However,\nI post them as a standard for my conduct as an adult.  Should any of\nmy friends or colleagues catch me violating any one of them, bust me.</p>"
