Do not\nendanger it frivolously.  And never endanger the life of another.</li>\n<li>Never lie to anyone for any reason.</li>\n<li>Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.</li>\n<li>Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission\nand pursue that.</li>\n<li>Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.</li>\n<li>Praise at least as often as you disparage.</li>\n<li>Never let your errors pass without admission.</li>\n<li>Become less suspicious of joy.</li>\n<li>Understand humility.\n21      Forgive.</li>\n<li>Foster dignity.</li>\n<li>Live memorably.</li>\n<li>Love yourself.</li>\n<li>Endure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the perfect attainment of these principles.  However,\nI post them as a standard for my conduct as an adult.  Should any of\nmy friends or colleagues catch me violating any one of them, bust me.</p>"
