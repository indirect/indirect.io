Like yeah I have reservations as well but the fact is the longer you spend working with this stuff the more chance you have of surviving the changes that are coming. The Torment Nexus is just a tool like any other; what&rsquo;s important is who uses it. The fact is that Torment Nexus Industries has put an enormous amount of R&amp;D into this, and the sheer scale of VC investment flowing in means these developments are inevitable anyway. Most of the critics don&rsquo;t even work with this technology and have no idea how nightmare extrusion works or even understand the basic principles of hyperagonisation. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about &ldquo;the orphans&rdquo;,"
