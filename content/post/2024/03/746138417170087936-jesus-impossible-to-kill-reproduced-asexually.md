text = "<p>Jesus: impossible to kill, reproduced asexually. Jesus is canonically a fungus. Clearly the part the Romans crucified was a fruiting body of some kind, leaving the bulk of the organism below ground, safe and secure. And every Easter, we find Jesus&rsquo; multi-colored spores hidden in dark places. The rabbits tried to warn us. But now it&rsquo;s too late. He&rsquo;s metastasized across the whole planet. Soon enough, he will come again, and when he does, no cross in the world will be big enough to keep him at bay.</p>\n\n<p>*Twilight Zone music intensifies*</p>"
