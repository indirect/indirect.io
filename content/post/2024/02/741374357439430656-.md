A house that wills itself into Postmodernism yet remains unable to let go of the kookiest moments of the prior zeitgeist, the Bruce Goffs and Earthships, the commune houses built from car windshields, the seventies moments of psychedelic hippie fracture. It is everything. It has everything. It is theme park, it is High Tech. It is Renaissance (in the San Antonio Riverwalk sense of the word.) It is medieval.

The environment created in service to transparency has to somewhat prevent the elements from penetrating too deep while retaining their desirable qualities. I don&rsquo;t think an architect designed this house. An architect would have had access to specifically engineered products for this purpose. Whoever built this house had certain access to architectural catalogues but not those used in the highest end or most structurally complex projects. The customization here lies in the assemblage of materials and in doing so stretches them to the height of their imaginative capacity. To borrow from Charles Jencks, ad-hoc is a perfect description. It is an architecture of availability and of adventure. </p><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1276\" data-orig-width=\"1916\"><img src=\"/images/4a/8c/e8308ea3702be7e78b35f46bcc19.png\" data-orig-height=\"1276\" data-orig-width=\"1916\" srcset=\"/images/cc/cf/f001c7c06ee1f60bf927a8fd4e4d.png 75w, /images/30/a8/a4f51245f0300721a9cc3b0d2a6c.png 100w, /images/4d/ca/993d294016e80fc84832a8d07693.png 250w, /images/f2/54/4b4f571aec9c944ce8bf0a0fef7a.png 400w, /images/cc/7f/ea9b9990e36de344acfa20f8bf69.png 500w, /images/b7/2c/eecafeba77f8561226627cff698f.png 540w, /images/4a/8c/e8308ea3702be7e78b35f46bcc19.png 640w, /images/d2/e9/70823f3d118bb95f991b0869ef77.png 1280w, /images/17/69/7d7ba3c824443da7b0aaef8822ef.png 1916w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"/></figure></div><p>A small interlude.

Living in a city is inherently exhibitionist. A house is a permeable visible surface; it is entirely possible that someone will catch a glimpse of me they&rsquo;re not supposed to when I rush to the living room in only a t-shirt to turn out the light before bed. But this is a space that is only exhibitionist in the sense that it is an architecture of exposure, and yet this exposure would not be possible without the protection of the site, of the distance from every other pair of eyes. In this respect, a double freedom is secured. The window intimates the potential of seeing.

Postmodern classicist columns of the Disney World set. The unpolished edge of the vernacular. There is also an organicist bent to the whole thing, something more Goff than Gaudí, and here we see some of the house&rsquo;s most organic forms, the monolith- or shell-like vanity mixed with the luminous artifice of mirrors and white.

A real ad-hocist. A genuine pioneer of fenestration. This house is in Alabama. It was built in 1980 and costs around $5 million. It is worth every penny. Perhaps more. </p><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1278\" data-orig-width=\"1924\"><img src=\"/images/63/d8/e31af387f1ed1032608afbae0f06.png\" data-orig-height=\"1278\" data-orig-width=\"1924\" srcset=\"/images/00/39/c96fc8a4ea1415d7c5f7c1040534.png 75w, /images/49/80/c7547f940789768ce916b9d5189c.png 100w, /images/2f/84/0d7a1e1ed1260f0fc34c2949806f.png 250w, /images/de/79/d2d5acc9151edf616d3e089f10a9.png 400w, /images/e3/39/04d295158c75e0cae151814d93ea.png 500w, /images/28/88/006c9d6dc982f7c3db72faa51f69.png 540w, /images/63/d8/e31af387f1ed1032608afbae0f06.png 640w, /images/2a/4b/1785d8f527d9b22645c2f035f675.png 1280w, /images/46/e0/be9266bc2a9fa953db7183b071a4.png 1924w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></figure></div><p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Come on, Kate, that’s a little kooky, but certainly it’s not McMansion Heaven.

Living in a city is inherently exhibitionist. A house is a permeable visible surface; it is entirely possible that someone will catch a glimpse of me they’re not supposed to when I rush to the living room in only a t-shirt to turn out the light before bed. But this is a space that is only exhibitionist in the sense that it is an architecture of exposure, and yet this exposure would not be possible without the protection of the site, of the distance from every other pair of eyes. In this respect, a double freedom is secured. The window intimates the potential of seeing.

Postmodern classicist columns of the Disney World set. The unpolished edge of the vernacular.

It is still an accumulation of deliberate signifiers of wealth, very much a construction with the secondary purpose of invoking envy, a palatial residence designed without much cohesion. The presence of golf, of wood, of masculine and patriarchal symbolism with an undercurrent of luxury drives that point home. The McMansion can aspire to an art form, but there are still many levels to ascend before one gets to where God’s sitting.</p><h2><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://patreon.com/mcmansionhell\">If you like this post and want more like it, support McMansion Hell on Patreon for as little as $1/month for access to great bonus content including a discord server, extra posts, and livestreams.</a></h2><h2><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://ko-fi.com/mcmansionhell\">Not into recurring payments?

It was built in 1980 and costs around $5 million. It is worth every penny. Perhaps more. </p><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1278\" data-orig-width=\"1924\"><img src=\"/images/63/d8/e31af387f1ed1032608afbae0f06.png\" data-orig-height=\"1278\" data-orig-width=\"1924\" srcset=\"/images/00/39/c96fc8a4ea1415d7c5f7c1040534.png 75w, /images/49/80/c7547f940789768ce916b9d5189c.png 100w, /images/2f/84/0d7a1e1ed1260f0fc34c2949806f.png 250w, /images/de/79/d2d5acc9151edf616d3e089f10a9.png 400w, /images/e3/39/04d295158c75e0cae151814d93ea.png 500w, /images/28/88/006c9d6dc982f7c3db72faa51f69.png 540w, /images/63/d8/e31af387f1ed1032608afbae0f06.png 640w, /images/2a/4b/1785d8f527d9b22645c2f035f675.png 1280w, /images/46/e0/be9266bc2a9fa953db7183b071a4.png 1924w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></figure></div><p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Come on, Kate, that’s a little kooky, but certainly it’s not McMansion Heaven.

It is everything. It has everything. It is theme park, it is High Tech. It is Renaissance (in the San Antonio Riverwalk sense of the word.) It is medieval.

Postmodern classicist columns of the Disney World set. The unpolished edge of the vernacular. There is also an organicist bent to the whole thing, something more Goff than Gaudí, and here we see some of the house’s most organic forms, the monolith- or shell-like vanity mixed with the luminous artifice of mirrors and white. A backlit cave, primitive and performative at the same time, which is, in essence, the dialectic of the luxury bathroom. </p><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1286\" data-orig-width=\"1924\"><img src=\"/images/5c/01/bc918682e5bcd2e21287c8026eb3.png\" data-orig-height=\"1286\" data-orig-width=\"1924\" srcset=\"/images/4c/04/4352c536f6ca3c9583b26dd58c61.png 75w, /images/ab/91/f78ba971a13c0c4f36686e9562f1.png 100w, /images/73/dd/59d4b1b79e16121eb8121470255d.png 250w, /images/ad/9c/50048820f68b7b6bfe8efb443eea.png 400w, /images/06/5d/a4533a258a595aaccc421dce6b3e.png 500w, /images/4d/3c/ed116b91714ee063b6e8e5dabac9.png 540w, /images/5c/01/bc918682e5bcd2e21287c8026eb3.png 640w, /images/a5/da/67de96692b23885b7d23522d944e.png 1280w, /images/30/72/c72b54f2905217371ce6b1e4bad0.png 1924w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></figure></div><p>And yet our McMansion Heaven is still a McMansion. It is still an accumulation of deliberate signifiers of wealth, very much a construction with the secondary purpose of invoking envy, a palatial residence designed without much cohesion. The presence of golf, of wood, of masculine and patriarchal symbolism with an undercurrent of luxury drives that point home. The McMansion can aspire to an art form, but there are still many levels to ascend before one gets to where God’s sitting.</p><h2><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://patreon.com/mcmansionhell\">If you like this post and want more like it, support McMansion Hell on Patreon for as little as $1/month for access to great bonus content including a discord server, extra posts, and livestreams.</a></h2><h2><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://ko-fi.com/mcmansionhell\">Not into recurring payments?
