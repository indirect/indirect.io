body = "<p>&ldquo;But surprisingly, rhodopsin is another example of convergent evolution, because it evolved twice in two separate kingdoms in the deep past. Once in Archaea and once in Eubacteria.<br/>This fact should shock us. The number of possible proteins is astronomical. There is an alphabet of 20 base symbols (amino acids), which make up every protein &quot;word&rdquo; which on average is say, 100 symbols, or 100 bases, long. (In fact many proteins are much longer, but for this calculation 100 is sufficient.) The total number of possible proteins that evolution could generate (or discover) is 100^20 or 10^39. This means that are more possible proteins than there are stars in the universe. But let&rsquo;s simplify that. Because only one in a million &ldquo;words&rdquo; fold into a functioning protein, let&rsquo;s vastly reduce that magnitude and agree that the number of potential working proteins is equal to the number of stars in the universe.
