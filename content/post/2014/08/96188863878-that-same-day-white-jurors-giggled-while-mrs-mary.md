text = "That same day white jurors giggled while Mrs. Mary Ruth Reed, a pregnant black sharecropper, testified that Lewis Medlin, a white mechanic, attempted to rape her in front of her five children. In an effort to get help, she scooped up her youngest child and ran across a field. Medlin knocked her down and pummeled her until a neighbor finally heard her screams and called the police. In court, Medlin’s attorney argued that he had been drinking and was “just having a little fun.” Then, turning to the white jurors, the attorney pointed to the woman sitting next to Medlin. “You see this pure white woman, this pure flower of life?” he said. “… This is Medlin’s wife … Do you think he would have left this pure flower, God’s greatest gift,” he asked, “for THAT?” Reed burst into tears as the jury broke for deliberation. Less than ten minutes later they returned a not guilty verdict."
