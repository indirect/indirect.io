Unless you give us a huge tax break hint hint.<br/>SF Mayor: We can&rsquo;t give you a tax break because we spent all our money on police. Would you like some extra police instead?<br/>Stores: Well actually we may have been fibbing a little about the crime, which statistics show is in fact down. But we really could use that tax break.<br/>Mayor: More police it is!"
