Suddenly, the baby says, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t open my parachute unless you renounce atheism and accept Jesus as your lord and savior.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You say, &ldquo;You are a baby, and can&rsquo;t talk; and further your arm is not strong enough to pull the ripcord. I am fairly sure you are a hallucination brought on by hypoxia.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The baby replies, &ldquo;Hypocrite that you are, for you trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you that they are chemicals. All knowledge is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove. Will you convert? Or will I perish like a dog?&rdquo;</p>"
