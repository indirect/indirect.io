In our world, we’ve got a government that does set limits on what companies can do because companies are fucking stupid and they fuck over the customers. In true capitalism you can’t have economics without a rule of law to act as the advocate of the customer.  Libertarians seem to think that companies could run things better. It’s interesting that any dumbfuck who thinks this hasn’t worked for a giant company before. Fuck, for any company.
